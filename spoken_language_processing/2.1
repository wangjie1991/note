2.1. SOUND AND HUMAN SPEECH SYSTEMS

2.1.1. Sound

Sound is a longitudinal(纵向的) |pressure wave|(压力波) formed of compressions(压缩) and rarefactions(稀疏) of |air molecules|(空气分子), in a direction parallel to that of the application of energy(能量的施用).

Compressions are zones where air molecules have been forced by the application of energy into a tighter-than-usual configuration(结构), and rarefactions are zones where air molecules are less tightly packed.

The alternating(交替的) configurations(结构) of compression and rarefaction of air molecules along the path of an energy source are sometimes described by the graph of a sine wave.

In this representation, crests(波峰) of the sine curve(曲线) correspond to moments of maximal compression and troughs(波谷) to moments of maximal rarefaction.

The use of the sine wave is only a |notational convenience| (概念上的便利) for charting |local pressure variations|(局部气压变化) over time, since sound does not form a transverse(横向的) wave, and the |air particles|(空气粒子) are just oscillating(振荡的) in place along the line of application of energy.

The speed of a sound pressure wave in air is approximately 331.5 + 0.6Tc m/ s, where Tc is the Celsius temperature.

The amount of work done to generate the energy that sets the air molecules in motion is reflected in the amount of displacement of the molecules from their resting position. This degree of displacement is measured as the amplitude of a sound as shown in Figure 2.2. Because of the wide range, it is convenient to measure sound amplitude on a logarithmic scale in decibels (dB). A decibel scale is actually a means for comparing two sounds:
