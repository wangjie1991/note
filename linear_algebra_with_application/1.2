solve systems of linear equations of arbitrary size
solve each equation for the leading variable, freely choose values for the
nonleading variables

Three properties for the simplicity of the solution:
1.The leading coefficient in each equation is 1.
2.The leading variable in each equation does not appear in any of the other
  equations.
3.The leading variables appear in the "natural order", with increasing
  indices as we go down the system.

Example:
2x[1] +  4x[2] — 2x[3] + 2x[4] + 4x[5] = 2
 x[1] +  2x[2] —  x[3] + 2x[4]         = 4
3x[1] +  6x[2] — 2x[3] +  x[4] + 9x[5] = 1
5x[1] + 10x[2] — 4x[3] + 5x[4] + 9x[5] = 9

Solution:
1  2  0  0  3 | 2
0  0  1  0 -1 | 4
0  0  0  1 -2 | 3
0  0  0  0  0 | 0


SOLVING A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

We proceed from equation to equation, from top to bottom.

Suppose we get to the [i]th equation. Let x[j] be the leading variable of
the system consisting of the [i]th and all the subsequent equations. (If
no variables are left in this system, then the process comes to an end.)
. If x[j] does not appear in the [i]th equation, swap the [i]th equation
  with the first equation below that does contain x[j].
. Suppose the coefficient of x[j] in the [i]th equation is c; Divide the
  [i]th equation by c.
. Eliminate x[j] from all the other equations, above and below the [i]th,
  by subtracting suitable multiples of the [i]th equation from the others.
Now proceed to the next equation.

If an equation zero = nonzero emerges in this process, then the system
fails to have solutions; the system is inconsistent.
When you are through without encountering an inconsistency, solve each
equation for its leading variable. You may choose the nonleading variables
freely; the leading variables are then determined by these choices.


REDUCED ROW-ECHELON FORM

A matrix is in reduced row-echelon form if it satisfies all of the
following conditions:
a.  If a row has nonzero entries, then the first nonzero entry is a 1,
    called the leading 1 (or pivot) in this row.
b.  If a column contains a leading 1, then all the other entries in that
    column are 0.
c.  If a row contains a leading 1, then each row above it contains a
    leading 1 further to the left.
Condition c implies that rows of 0’s, if any, appear at the bottom of the matrix.


TYPES OF ELEMENTARY ROW OPERATIONS
. Divide a row by a nonzero scalar.
. Subtract a multiple of a row from another row.
. Swap two rows.


An algorithm definition:
a finite procedure, written in a fixed symbolic vocabulary, governed by precise instructions, moving in discrete Steps, 1, 2, 3, ..., whose execution requires no insight, cleverness, intuition, intelligence, or perspicuity, and that sooner or later comes to an end.
