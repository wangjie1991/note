                        Chapter 1  Linear Equations

1.1 Introduction to linear systems


System of linear equations:
|  x + 2y + 3z = 39 |
|  x + 3y + 2z = 34 |
| 3x + 2y +  z = 26 |

The form of solution:
| x     = ? |
|   y   = ? |
|     z = ? | 

1.Eliminate the terms that are off the diagonal.
2.Make the coefficients along the diagonal equal to 1.


Method:
1.Eliminate the variable x from the second and third equation by subtracing
  the first equation.
2.Eliminate the variable y from the third equation by subtracing the second
  equation.
3.Get variable z in third equation, then y in second, x in first.
4.Check the result is indeed the solution of the system by calculate every
  equation.


Geometric interpretation
The planes defined by the three equations intersect at one point.


A system of linear equations may has:
1.a unique solution
2.infinitely many solutions
  | x   -  z = 2  |
  |   y + 2z = -1 |
  |        0 = 0  |
3.no solutions
  | x   -  z = 2  |
  |   y + 2z = -1 |
  |        0 = -6 |


Problem
1.It's easy to check our result when the system has a unique solution or
  infinitely many solutions. How can we check there is indeed no solutions
  in the linear system.


Exercises 1.1

19.two-commodity market
P1 P2 : the unit prices of the products
D1 D2 : the quantities demanded
S1 S2 : the quantities supplied

D1 = 70 - 2P1 + P2, S1 = -14 + 3P1;
D2 = 105 + P1 - P2, S2 = -7 + 2P2.

the higher of the price, the less of demand, the more of supply
see D1 and D2. the less of P1, the more of D1 and less of D2. the same with
P2. So the two commodities are compete relationship.

D1 = S1   5P1 -  P2 = 84      P1 = 26
D2 = S2   P1  - 3P2 = -112    P2 = 46
