                  Chapter 2  Linear Transformation

2.1 Introduction to Linear Transformations and Their Inverses

# linear transformations are a special class of functions #

The concept of function
1.  two sets X and Y.
2.  a rule T associates each element x of X with a unique element y of Y.
3.  the set X is the domain of the function. 
4.  the set Y is the target space.
5.  x as the input and y as the output.

In precalculus and calculus, the input and output of functions are scalars,
which domain and target space are the real number R or subsets of R.

A function T from R[m] to R[n] is called a linear transformation if there
exists an n*m matrix A such that T(x)=Ax for all x in the vector space R[m].

A first-order function with a constant term is called linear.

The coefficient matrix of the identity transformation is called the
identity matrix and is denoted by I[n], such as rref(A).
