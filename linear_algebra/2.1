                  Chapter 2  Linear Transformation

2.1 Introduction to Linear Transformations and Their Inverses

# linear transformations are a special class of functions #

The concept of function
1.  two sets X and Y.
2.  a rule T associates each element x of X with a unique element y of Y.
3.  the set X is the domain of the function. 
4.  the set Y is the target space.
5.  x as the input and y as the output.

In precalculus and calculus, the input and output of functions are scalars,
which domain and target space are the real number R or subsets of R.

A function T from R[m] to R[n] is called a linear transformation if there
exists an n*m matrix A such that T(x)=Ax for all x in the vector space R[m].

A first-order function with a constant term is called linear.

The coefficient matrix of the identity transformation is called the
identity matrix and is denoted by I[n], such as rref(A).


A linear transformation T(x)=Ax from R[m] to R[n], then:
1.the transform of the sum of two vectors equals the sum of the transforms.
2.the transform of a scalar multiple 

proof:
T(v+w) = A(v+w) = Av + Aw = T(v) + T(w)
T(kv) = A(kv) = kAv = kT(v)

A transformation T from R[m] to R[n] is linear if (and only if):
1.T(v+w) = T(v) + T(w), for all vectors v and w in R[m].
2.T(kv) = kT(v), for all vectors v in R[m] and all scalars k.

proof:
To show there exists a matrix A such that T(x)=Ax, for all x in the vector
space R[m].
Let e[1],...,e[m] be the standard vectors, x = x[1]e[1] + ... + x[m]e[m].
T(x) = T(x[1]e[1] + ... + x[m]e[m]) = T(x[1]e[1]) + ... + T(x[m]e[m]) (1)
     = x[1]T(e[1]) + ... + x[m]T(e[m]) (2)
     = [ T(e[1]) ... T(e[m]) ] [ x[1] ... x[m] ]
     = Ax
