2.4 The Inverse of a Linear Transformation

Invertible Functions:
A function T from X to Y is called invertible if the equation T(x) = y has
a unique solution x in X for each y in Y.

The inverse T` from Y to X:
T`(y) = (the unique x in X such that T(x)=y).
x=T`(y), y=T(x), T`(T(x))=x, T(T`(y))=y.


Invertible matrices:
A square matrix A is said to be invertible if the linear transformation y=T(x)=Ax is invertible.
In this case, the matrix of T` is denoted by A`.
If the linear transformation y=T(x)=Ax is invertible, then its inverse is x=T`(y)=A`y.

Invertibility(exist):
An n*n matrix A is invertible if and only if rref(A)=n, or rank(A)=n.

Finding of the inverse of a matrix(property):
T`(T(x))=x ==> A`Ax=x=I[n] ==> A`A=I[n]. The same as AA`=I[n].
(BA)`=B`A`.

A criterion for invertibility(practise):
A and B are two n*n matrices and BA=I[n], then:
a. A and B are both invertible.
b. A` = B and B` = A.
c. AB = I[n].

Proof:
a.If A is invertible, Ax=0 has only the solution x=0. As Ax=0 => BAx=B0=0,
  So I[n]x=0, I[n] is n*n matrix, x has only the solution x=0, namely Ax=0
  has the only solution x=0.
b and c is easy.

A, B, C are n*n matrices and ABC=I, proof B is invertible and express B`.
ABC=I => (AB)C=I => C is invertible and C(AB)=I => (CA)B=I => B`=CA.
