3.4 Coordinates

Definition 3.4.1  Coordinates in a subspace of R[n]
Consider a basis B=(v[1],...,v[m]) of a subspace V of R[n]. then any vector x in V can be written uniquely as:
    x = c[1]v[1] + ... + c[m]v[m]
The scalars c[1],...,c[m] are called the B-coordinates of x, and the vector [ c[1] ... c[m] ] is the B-coordinate vector of x, denoted by [x][B]. then:
[x][B] = [ c[1] ... c[m] ] and x = S[x][B], S = [ v[1] ... v[m] ].

Theorem 3.4.2 Linearity of Coordinates
If B is a basis of a subspace V of R[n], then:
a. [x + y][B] = [x][B] + [y][B], for all vectors x and y in V.
b. [kx][B] = k[x][B], for all x in V and for all scalars k.
