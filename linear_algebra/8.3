8.3 Singular Values

EXAMPLE 1
If L(x)=Ax is a linear transformation from R[2] to R[2], then there exist two orthogonal unit vectors v1 and v2 in R[2] such that vectors L(v1) and L(v2) are orthogonal.

A^A is symmetric. According to the spectral theorem (Theorem 8.1.1), there exists an orthonormal eigenbasis v1,v2 for A^A, with associated eigenvalues λ1, λ2. So that vectors L(v1)=Av1 and L(v2)=Av2 are orthogonal.
(Av1).(Av2) = (Av1)^(Av2) = v1^A^Av2 = v1^(λ2v2) = λ2(v1.v2) = 0.
It is worth mentioning that v1 and v2 need not be eigenvectors of matrix A.

Definition 8.3.1  Singular values
The singular values of an n*m matrix A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the symmetric m*m matrix A^A, listed with their algebraic multiplicities. It is customary to denote the singular values by σ1, σ2, ..., σm and to list them in decreasing order:
  σ1 >= σ2 >= ... >= σm >= 0

EXAMPLE 2
Consider the linear transformation L(x) = Ax. Show that the image of the unit circle under transformation L is an ellipse.

The unit circle consists of the vectors of the form x = cos(t)v1 + sin(t)v2, and the image of the unit circle consists of the vectors L(x) = cos(t)L(v1) + sin(t)L(v2). This image is the ellipse whose semimajor and semiminor axes are L(v1) and L(v2).

Theorem 8.3.2 The image of the unit circle
Let L(x) = Ax be an invertible linear transformation from R[2] to R[2]. The image of the unit circle under L is an ellipse E. The lengths of the semimajor and the semiminor axes of E are the singular values σ1 and σ2.

Theorem 8.3.3
Let L(x) = Ax be a linear transformation from R[m] to R[n]. Then there exists an orthonormal basis v[1],v[2],...,v[m] of R[m] such that:
a. Vectors L(v[1]), L(v[2]), ..., L(v[m]) are orthogonal.
b. The lengths of vectors L(v[1]), L(v[2]), ..., L(v[m]) are the singular values σ1, σ2, ..., σm of matrix A.

To construct eigenbasis v[1],v[2],...,v[m] for matrix A^A. The corresponding eigenvalues λ[1],λ[2],...,λ[m] appear in descending order. So that λ[i]=(σ[i])**2 for i = 1,...,m.
a. L(v[i]).L(v[j]) = (Av[i]).(Av[j]) = (Av[i])^(Av[j]) = v[i]^A^Av[j] = v[i]^(λ[j]v[j]) = λ[j](v[i]^v[j]) = 0, when i != j.
b. #L(v[i])#**2 = (Av[i]).(Av[i]) = v[i]^A^Av[i] = v[i]^(λ[i]v[i]) = λ[i](v[i]^v[i]) = λ[i] = σ[i]**2.

The unit sphere in R[3] consists of all vectors of the form x = c[1]v[1] + c[2]v[2] + c[3]v[3], where c[1]**2 + c[2]**2 + c[3]**2 = 1.

Suppose the singular values σ[1],σ[2],...,σ[s] of an n*m matrix A are nonzero, while σ[s+1],...,σ[m] are zero. Choose vectors v[1],...,v[s],v[s+1],...,v[m] for A. Note that #Av[i]# = σ[i] = 0 and therefore Av[i] = 0 for i = s+1,...,m. We claim that the vectors Av[1],...Av[s] form a basis of the image of A. 

Theorem 8.3.4 Singular values and rank
If A is an n*m matrix of rank r, then the singular values σ[1],...,σ[r] are nonzero, while σ[r+1],...,σ[m] are zero.

The Singular Value Decomposition
Consider a linear transformation L(x) = Ax from R[m] to R[n], and choose an orthonormal basis v[1],...,v[m] of R[m]. Let r = rank(A). We know that the vectors Av[1],...,Av[r] are orthogonal and nonzero, with #Av[i]# = σ[i].
We introduce the unit vectors
