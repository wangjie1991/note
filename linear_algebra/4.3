4.3 Matrix of a Linear Transformation

Definition 4.3.1  The B-matrix of a linear transformation
Consider a linear transformation T from V to V, where V is an n-dimensional 
linear space. Let B be a basis of V. Consider the linear transformation 
L[B], T, L[B]` from R[n] to R[n] with standard matrix B, meaning that 
Bx = L[B](T(L[B]`(x))) for all x in R[n]. This matrix B is called the 
B-matrix of transformation T. Letting f = L[B]`(x) and x = [f][B], we find
that [T(f)][B] = B[f][B], for all f in V.
    f   -----T-----> T(f)
    |                |
    L[B]             L[B]
    |                |
    [f][B]---B-----> [T(f)][B]

B = (f1, f2, ...,fn), [T(fi)][B] = B[fi][B] = Be[i] = (ith column of B) ==>
B = [ [T(f1)][B] ... [T(fn)][B] ]

Definition 4.3.3  Change of basis matrix
Consider two bases Π and Β of an n-dimensional linear space V. Consider the
linear transformation L[Π] o L`[Β] from R[n] to R[n], with standard matrix 
S, meaning that Sx = L[Π](L`[Β](x)) for all x in R[n]. This invertible 
matrix S is called the change of basis matrix from Β to Π. Letting 
f = L`[Β](x) and x = [f][B], we find that [f][Π] = S[f][Β], for all f in V.
If Β = (b1, ..., bn), then [bi][Π] = S[bi][Β] = Se[i] = (ith column of S).

S = [ [b1][Π] ... [bn][Π] ]

Theorem 4.3.5 Change of basis for the matrix of a linear transformation
Let V be a linear space with two given bases Π and Β. Consider a linear
transformation T from V to V, and let A and B be the Π- and the Β-matrix
of T. Let S be the change of basis matrix from Π to Β.
  [T(f)][Π] = AS[f][B] = SB[f][B]
Then A is similar to B and AS = SB or A = SBS` or B = S`AS.
