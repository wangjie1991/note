                    Chapter 9 Linear Differential Equations

9.1 An Introduction to Continuous Dynamical Systems

Theorem 9.1.1 Exponential growth and decay
Consider the linear differential equation dx/dt = kx, with initial value x[0] (k is an arbitrary constant). The solution is x(t) = (e**(kt))x[0].
