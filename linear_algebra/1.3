1.3 On the solutions of linear systems: Matrix Algebra

Topic:
1.  The number of solutions of a linear system
2.  Definitions and rules of matrix algebra

A system is inconsistant, then it has no solutions.
A system is consistant, then it has either
. infinitely many solutions(at least one free variable) or
. exactly one solution(all the variables are leading).

The rank of a matrix A is the number of leading lâ€™s in rref(A).
The rank of a linear system must specify whether the coefficient matrix or the augmented matrix of the system.

A system of n linear equations in m variables. The coefficient matrix A has the size n*m. Then:
a.  The inequalities rank(A) <= n and rank(A) <= m hold.
b.  If rank(A) = n, then the system is consistent.
c.  If rank(A) = m, then the system has at most one solution.
    number(free variables) = m - rank(A)
d.  If rank(A) < m, then the system has either infinitely many solutions,
    or none.

For a linear system with fewer equations than variables:
n < m and rank(A) <= n, so rank(A) < m, match for condition d.

For a linear system of n equations in n variables:
1.  rank(A) < n, match for condition d.
2.  rank(A) = n, match for condition b and c. A unique solution.


Matrix Algebra
1.  sums of matrices
2.  scalar multiples of matrices
3.  dot product of vectors
4.  the product Ax
5.  the product Ax in terms of the columns of A
6.  linear combinations

Algebra rules for Ax
If A is an n*m matrix, x and y are vectors in R[m], and k is a scalar, then:
a.  A(x + y) = Ax + Ay
b.  A(kx) = k(Ax)

Matrix form of a linear system
Ax = b    &&    [A | b]
