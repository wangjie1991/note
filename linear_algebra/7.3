7.3 Finding the Eigenvectors of a Matrix

Definition 7.3.1  Eigenspaces
Consider an eigenvalue λ of an n*n matrix A. Then the kernel of the matrix A-λI[n] is called the eigenspace associated with λ, denoted by E[λ]:
    E[λ] = ker(A - λI[n]) = {v in R[n]: Av = λv}.
The eigenvectors with eigenvalue λ are the nonzero vectors.

Definition 7.3.2  Geometric multiplicity
Consider an eigenvalue λ of an n*n matrix A. The dimension of eigenspace E[λ] = ker(A - λI[n]) is called the geometric multiplicity of eigenvalue λ. Thus, the geometric multiplicity is the nullity of matrix A - λI[n], or n - rank(A - λI[n]).

Definition 7.3.3  Eigenbasis
Consider an n*n matrix A. A basis of R[n] consisting of eigenvectors of A is called an eigenbasis for A.

a. For which square matrices does there exist an eigenbasis?
b. If eigenbases exist, how can we find one?

Theorem 7.3.4 Eigenbases and geometric multiplicities
a. Consider an n*n matrix A. If we find a basis of each eigenspace of A and 
   concatenate all these bases, then the resulting eigenvectors v[1],...,
   v[s] will be linearly independent. (Note that s is the sum of the 
   geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues of A.)
b. There exists an eigenbasis for an n*n matrix A if (and only if) the 
   geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues add up to n (meaning that 
   s=n in part a).

Proof:
a. 
b.

Theorem 7.3.5 An n*n matrix with n distinct eigenvalues
If an n*n matrix A has n distinct eigenvalues, then there exists an eigenbasis for A. We can construct an eigenbasis by finding an eigenvector for each eigenvalue.

Theorem 7.3.6 The eigenvalues of similar matrices
Matrix A is similar to B. Then:
a. Matrices A and B have the same characteristic polynomial, that is, 
   f[A](λ) = f[B](λ).
b. rank(A) = rank(B) and nullity(A) = nullity(B).
c. Matrices A and B have the same eigenvalues, with the same algebraic and
   geometric multiplicities.
d. Matrices A and B have the same determinant and the same trace:
   det A = det B and tr A = tr B.

Theorem 7.3.7 Algebraic versus geometric multiplicity
If A is an eigenvalue of a square matrix A, then:
  (geometric multiplicity of A) <= (algebraic multiplicity of A).
