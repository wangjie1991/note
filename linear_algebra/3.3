3.3 The Dimension of a Subspace of R[n]

Theorem 3.3.1
For vectors v[1]...v[p] and w[1]...w[q] in a subspace V of R[n], if v[1]...v[p] are linearly independent, and w[1]...w[q] span V , then p<=q.

Proof:
A=[ w[1] ... w[q] ], B=[ v[1] ... v[p] ], im(A)=V. The vector v[i] is in V, so v[i] is in the image of A. ==> v[i] = Au[i] ==> B=A[ u[1] ... u[p] ]=AC.
If Cx=0, then ACx=0, Bx=0, so ker(C) is a subset of ker(B). And ker(B)={0} ==> ker(C)={0}. C is a q*p matrix ==> q>=p.

Theorem 3.3.2   Number of vectors in a basis
All bases of a subspace V of R[n] consist of the same number of vectors.

Proof:
