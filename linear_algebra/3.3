            Chapter 3  Subspaces of R[n] and Their Dimensions

3.3 The Dimension of a Subspace of R[n]

Theorem 3.3.1
For vectors v[1]...v[p] and w[1]...w[q] in a subspace V of R[n], if v[1]...v[p] are linearly independent, and w[1]...w[q] span V, then p<=q.

Proof:
A=[ w[1] ... w[q] ], B=[ v[1] ... v[p] ], im(A)=V. The vector v[i] is in V, so v[i] is in the image of A. ==> v[i] = Au[i] ==> B=A[ u[1] ... u[p] ]=AC.
If Cx=0, then ACx=0, Bx=0, so ker(C) is a subset of ker(B). And ker(B)={0} ==> ker(C)={0}. C is a q*p matrix ==> q>=p.

Theorem 3.3.2   Number of vectors in a basis
All bases of a subspace V of R[n] consist of the same number of vectors.

Proof:
For two bases v[1]...v[p] and w[1]...w[q] of V.
v[1]...v[p] are linearly independent and w[1]...w[q] span V, then p<=q.
w[1]...w[q] are linearly independent and v[1]...v[p] span V, then q<=p.

Definition 3.3.3  Dimension
For a subspace V of R[n]. The number of vectors in a basis of V is called the dimension of V, denoted by dim(V).

Theorem 3.3.4 Independent vectors and spanning vectors in a subspace of R[n]
For a subspace V of R[n] with dim(V) = m.
a. We can find at most m linearly independent vectors in V.
b. We need at least m vectors to span V.
c. If m vectors in V are linearly independent, then they form a basis of V.
d. If m vectors in V span V, then they form a basis of V.

kernel and image of a linear transformation are subspaces of the domain and the target space. ==> find bases of the image and kernel.

Consider the matrix A:
a. Find a basis of the kernel of A, and thus determine the dimension of the kernel. ==> Ax=0 ==> x=By.
b. Find a basis of the image of A , and thus determine the dimension of the image. ==> A=[ v[1] ... v[m] ] ==> use rref to find redundant ==> bases.

Theorem 3.3.5  Using rref to construct a basis of the image 
To construct a basis of the image of A, pick the column vectors of A that correspond to the columns of rref(A) containing the leading 1’s.

Theorem 3.3.6 Dimension of the image
For any matrix A, dim(imA) = rank(A).

Theorem 3.3.7 Rank-Nullity Theorem
For any n*m matrix A, dim(ker A) + dim(im A) = m.
The dimension of ker(A) is called the nullity of A, so (nullity of A) - (rank of A) = m. It's the fundamental theorem of linear algebra.
m — dim(ker A) = dim(im A)

SUMMARY 3.3.10  Various characterizations of invertible matrices
For an n*n matrix A, the following statements are equivalent.
1. A is invertible.
2. The linear system Ax=b has a unique solution x, for all b in R[n].
3. rref(A) = n.
4. rank(A) = n.
5. im(A) = R[n].
6. ker(A) = {0}.
7. The column vectors of A form a basis of R[n].
8. The column vectors of A span R[n].
9. The column vectors of A are linearly independent.
