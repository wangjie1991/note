3.1 Image and Kernel of a Linear Transformation

Definition 3.1.1  Image of a function
The image of a function is all the values in the target space.
image(f) = {f(x) : x in X}

Definition 3.1.2  Span
The set of all linear combinations c(1)v(1)+...+c(m)v(m) is called span.

Theorem 3.1.3   Image of a linear transformation
The image of a linear transformation T(x)=Ax is the span of the column vectors of A, denoted by im(T) or im(A).

Theorem 3.1.4   Some properties of the image
The image of a linear transformation T has the following properties:
a. The zero vector in R[n] is in the image of T.
b. The image of T is CLOSED UNDER ADDITION: 
   If v1 and v2 are in the image of T, then so is v1+v2.
c. The image of T is CLOSED UNDER SCALAR MULTIPLICATION:
   If v is in the image of T and k is an arbitrary scalar, 
   then kv is in the image of T as well.
d. the image of T is CLOSED UNDER LINEAR COMBINATIONS:
   If some vectors v(1)...v(p) are in the image and c(1)...c(p) are 
   arbitrary scalars, then c(1)v(1) + ... + c(p)v(p) is in the image.

A is an n*n matrix, im(AA) is a subset of im(A).
b=AAx=A(Ax) => a=Ax in im(A) => b=A(Ax)=Aa in im(A).

Definition 3.1.5  Kernel
The kernel of a linear transformation T is the solution set of the linear system Ax=0, denoted by ker(T) or ker(A).

For a linear transformation T from R[m] to R[n]:
1.im(T) = { T(x) : x in R[m] } is a subset of the target space R[n] of T.
2.ker(T) = { x in R[m] : T(x)=0 } is a subset of the domain R[m] of T.

Theorem 3.1.6   Some Properties of The Kernel
a. The zero vector 0 in R[m] is in the kernel of T.
b. The kernel is closed under addition.
c. The kernel is closed under scalar multiplication.

For an invertible n*n matrix A, ker(A)={vector 0}.

ker(A)={vector 0} conditions:
a.For an n*m matrix A, ker(A)={vector 0} if (and only if) rank(A)=m.
b.For an n*m matrix A, if ker(A)={vector 0}, then m<n.
  Equivalently, if m>n, then there are nonzero vectors in the kernel of A.
c.For a square matrix A, ker(A)={vector 0} if (and only if) A is invertible.

For an n*n matrix A, the following statements are equivalent:
1. A is invertible.
2. The linear system Ax=b has a unique solution x, for all b in R[n].
3. rref(A) = n.
4. rank(A) = n.
5. im(A) = R[n].
6. ker(A) = {vector 0}.
