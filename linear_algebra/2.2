2.2 Linear Transformations in Geometry

Geometrical Transformations
[ a[11] a[12] a[21] a[22] ] [ x y ] = [ a[11]x+a[12]y a[21]x+a[22]y ]


1.Scalings
The matrix A=[ [k 0] [0 k] ] defines a scaling by k.
Ax = [ [k 0] [0 k] ] [ x[1] x[2] ] = [ kx[1] kx[2] ] = k [ x[1] x[2] ] = kx
1) k > 1, a dilation (or enlargement).
2) 0 < k < 1, a contraction (or shrinking).
3) k = 0, contract to a point.
4) -1 < k < 0, a contraction in the oppositive direction.
5) k < -1, a dilation in the oppositive direction.


2.Orthogonal Projections

L is a line in the plane, running through the origin.
L| is the line through the origin perpendicular to L.
x is Any vector in R[2] and is written uniquely as x = x_ + x|.
x_ is parallel to line L, x| is perpendicular to L.
w is a nonzero vector parallel to L.

The transformation T(x)=x_ from R2 to R2 is called orthogonal projection of x onto L, and is denoted by proj[L](x) = x_.
x| is parallel to L|. It's the orthogonal projection of x onto L|.

x_=kw, x|=x-x_=x-kw, x| . w = (x-kw).w = 0, so
proj[L](x) = x_ = kw = (x.w/w.w)w
if w is a unit vector u, then
proj[L](x) = (x.u)u = [ [u1*u1 u1*u2] [u1*u2 u2*u2] ] [x[1] x[2]]
           = 1/(w1*w1+w2*w2) [ [w1*w1 w1*w2] [w1*w2 w2*w2] ] [x[1] x[2]]


3.Reflection

L is a line in the plane, running through the origin.
x is Any vector in R[2] and is written uniquely as x = x_ + x|.
The reflection of x is obtained by flipping vector x over the line L.

The linear transformation T(x) = x_ - x| is called the reflection of x about L, denoted by ref[L](x).

ref[L](x) = x_ - x| = x - 2x| = 2x_ - x = 2proj[L](x) - x = 2(x.u)u - x.
          = [ [u1**2-u2**2 2*u1*u2] [2*u1*u2 u2**2-u1**2] ] [x[1] x[2]]
          = [ [a b] [b -a] ] [x[1] x[2]] (a**2 + b**2 = 1)


4.Orthogonal Projections and Reflections in Space
Consider orthogonal projections and reflections in multiple dimension space.

L is a line in the space(three dimentions), running through the origin.
x is Any vector in R[3] and is written uniquely as x = x_ + x|.
L|=V is the plane through the origin perpendicular to L.

proj[L](x) = x_ = (x.u)u
proj[V](x) = x - proj[L](x) = x - (x.u)u
ref[L](x) = proj[L](x) - proj[V](x) = 2(x.u)u - x
ref[V](x) = proj[V](x) - proj[L](x) = -ref[L](x) = x - 2(x.u)u


5.Rotations

The linear transformation T from R[2] to R[2] rotates any vector x through a fixed angle θ in the counterclockwise direction.
x is Any vector [x[1] x[2]], y is obtained by rotating x through π/2, namely [-x[2] x[1]].

T(x) = (cosθ)x + (sinθ)y = [[cosθ sinθ] [-sinθ cosθ]]x = [[a b] [-b a]]x
(a**2 + b**2 = 1)


6.Rotations Combined with a Scaling

Matrix [[a b] [-b a]] represents a rotation combined with a scaling.
Vector [a b] is [rcosθ rsinθ] in the polar coordination, then [[a b] [-b a]]
represents a rotation through θ combined with a scaling by r.

7.Shears
vertical shear T(x)=[[1 k] [0 1]]x
horizontal shear T(x)=[[1 0] [k 1]]x
