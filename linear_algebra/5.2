5.2 Gram-Schmidt Process and QR Factorization
An algorithm that convert any basis v[1],...,v[m] of a subspace V of R[n] into an orthonormal basis u[1],...,u[m] of V.

low-dimensional cases:
1). find an orthonormal basis u[1] = (1/#v[1]#)v.
2). v[2] = v[2]_ + v[2]|, v[2]_ is parallel with u[1].
3). v[2]| = v[2] - v[2]_ = v[2] - (u[1].v[2])u[1]
4). u[2] = (1/#v[2]|#)(v[2]|)

[ v[1] v[2] ] = [ u[1] u[2] ] [c1 c2]
    M         =       Q          R
This is refered to as the QR factorization of Matrix M.

Theorem 5.2.1 The Gram-Schmidt process
Consider a basis v[1],...,v[m] of a subspace V of R[n]. For j=2,...,m, we resolve the vector v[j] into its components parallel and perpendicular to the span of the preceding vectors, v[1],...,v[j-1]:
  v[j] = v[j]_ + v[j]| , with respect to span(v[1],...,v[j-1])
then:
  u[1] = (1/#v[1]#)v[1],..., u[m] = (1/#v[m]|#)v[m]|
and:
  v[j]| = v[j] - v[j]_ = v[j] - (u[1].v[j])u[1] - ... - (u[j-1].v[j])u[j-1]

Β=(v[1],...,v[m]), Π=(u[1],...,u[m]), So [v[1]  v[m]] = [u[1]  u[m]]R.
The relationship among the matrices M,Q and R.

[j]th column of R are the coordinates of v[j] with respect to the basis  Π=(u[1],...,u[m]).
r[ij] in R(upper triangular) with the rule:
a. i<j, r[ij] = u[i].v[j].
b. i=j, r[ij] = #v[j]|#.
c. i>j, r[ij] = 0.

Theorem 5.2.2 QR factorization
Consider an n*m matrix M with linearly independent columns v[1],...,v[m].
Then there exists an n*m matrix Q whose columns u[1],...,u[m] are orthonormal and an upper triangular matrix R with positive diagonal entries such that M = QR.
This representation is unique. Furthermore, r[11]=#v[1]#, r[jj]=#v[j]|#
(j=2,...,m), and r[ij]=u[i].v[j](for i<j).
