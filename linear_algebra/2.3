                  Chapter 2  Linear Transformation

2.3 Matrix Products

Consider the position coding example in the previous chapters, encoding and
decoding is a linear transformation. Now the position data need to be
encoded twice, y=Ax, z=By. So the transformation from x to z is linear or
not?
Proof:
T(v+w) = B(A(v+w)) = B(Av + Aw) = B(Av) + B(Aw) = T(v) + T(w)
T(kv) = B(A(kv)) = B(k(Av)) = k(B(Av)) = kT(v)


Matrix multiplication

B is an n*p matrix and A is a q*m matrix.
1.The product BA is defined if and only if p = q.
  The target space of B must be the same with the domain of A.
2.The product BA is defined as the matrix of the linear transformation
  T(x) = B(Ax) = (BA)x.

[i]th column of BA = (BA)e[i] = B(Ae[i]) = B([i]th column of A).
If A = [v[1] ... v[m]], then BA = [Bv[1] ... Bv[m]]


Some matrix algebra

1.Matrix multiplication is noncommutative

2.Multiplying with the identity matrix
  For an n*m matrix A, AI[m] = I[n]A = A.

3.Matrix multiplication is associative
  For an n*p matrix A, a p*q matrix B, and a q*m matrix C, (AB)C = A(BC).

Proof1:
C = [v[1] ... v[m]] and (AB)v[i] = A(Bv[i])             ==>
(AB)C = [(AB)v[1] .. (AB)v[m]].                         ==> (AB)C = A(BC)
A(BC) = A[Bv[1] ... Bv[m]] = [A(Bv[1]) ... A(Bv[m])].   ==>

Proof2:
T(x) = ((AB)C)x and L(x) = (A(BC))x     ==>
T(x) = ((AB)C)x = (AB)(Cx) = A(B(Cx))   ==> (AB)C = A(BC)
L(x) = (A(BC))x = A((BC)x) = A(B(Cx))   ==>

4.Distributive property for matrices
A and B are n*p matrices, C and D are p*m matrices, then
      A(C+D) = AC + AD      (A+B)C = AC + BC

5.A is an n*p matrix, B is a p*m matrix, and k is a scalar, then
  (kA)B = A(kB) = k(AB)
