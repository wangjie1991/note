7.3 Finding the Eigenvectors of a Matrix

Definition 7.3.1  Eigenspaces
Consider an eigenvalue λ of an n*n matrix A. Then the kernel of the matrix A-λI[n] is called the eigenspace associated with λ, denoted by E[λ]:
    E[λ] = ker(A - λI[n]) = {v in R[n]: Av = λv}.
The eigenvectors with eigenvalue λ are the nonzero vectors.

Definition 7.3.2  Geometric multiplicity
Consider an eigenvalue λ of an n*n matrix A. The dimension of eigenspace E[λ] = ker(A - λI[n]) is called the geometric multiplicity of eigenvalue λ. Thus, the geometric multiplicity is the nullity of matrix A - λI[n], or n - rank(A - λI[n]).

Definition 7.3.3  Eigenbasis
Consider an n*n matrix A. A basis of R[n] consisting of eigenvectors of A is called an eigenbasis for A.

a. For which square matrices does there exist an eigenbasis?
b. If eigenbases exist, how can we find one?

Theorem 7.3.4 Eigenbases and geometric multiplicities
a. Consider an n*n matrix A. If we find a basis of each eigenspace of A and concatenate all these bases, then the resulting eigenvectors v\ ........vs will be linearly independent. (Note that s is the sum of the geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues of A.)
