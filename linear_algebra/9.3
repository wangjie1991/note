                    Chapter 9 Linear Differential Equations

9.2 Linear Differential Operators and Linear Differential Equations

In this final section, we will study an important class of linear transformations from C[oo] to C[oo]. Here, C[oo] denotes the linear space of complex-valued smooth functions(functions from R to C), which we consider as a linear space over C.
