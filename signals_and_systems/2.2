2.2 CONTINUOUS-TIME LTI SYSTEMS: THE CONVOLUTION INTEGRAL

2.2.1 The Representation of Continuous-Time Signals in Terms of Impulses
To develop the continuous-time counterpart of the discrete-time sifting property in eq.(2.2), we begin by considering a pulse or 'staircase' approximation, x^(t), to a continuous-time signal x(t). This approximation can be expressed as a linear combination of delayed pulses. If we define
                      δ[∆](t) = { 1/∆, 0 ≤ t < ∆  (2.24)
                                { 0,   otherwise
Since Δδ[Δ](t) has unit amplitude, we have the expression
                 x^(t) = ∑[k=-∞,∞]{x(k∆)(δ[∆](t-k∆))∆}  (2.25)
