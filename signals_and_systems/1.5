1.5 CONTINUOUS-TIME AND DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEMS

A system can be viewed as a process in which input signals are transformed by the system or cause the system to respond in some way, resulting in other signals as outputs.

A continuous-time system is a system in which continuous-time input signals are applied and result in continuous-time output signals. we often represent the input-output relation of a continuous-time system by the notation
                              x(t) -> y(t)  (1.78)
Similarly, a discrete-time system is a system that transforms discrete-time inputs into discrete-time outputs. It's represented as
                              x[n] -> y[n]  (1.79)

The concept of the interconnection of systems is an important idea.
