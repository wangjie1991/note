1.1.2 Signal Energy and Power
The total energy over the time interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 in a continuous-time signal x(t) is defined as 
                        ∫[t1,t2]{|x(t)|**2}dt.    (1.4)

The total energy in a discrete-time signal x[n] over the time interval n1 ≤ n ≤ n2 is defined as
                         ∑[n=n1,n2]{|x[n]|**2}.  (1.5)
