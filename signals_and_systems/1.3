1.3 EXPONENTIAL AND SINUSOIDAL SIGNALS

1.3.1   Continuous-Time Complex Exponential and Sinusoidal Signals
The continuous-time complex exponential signal is of the form
                             x(t) = Ce**(at) (1.20)
where C and a are complex numbers. Depending upon the values of these parameters, the complex exponential can exhibit several different characteristics.
