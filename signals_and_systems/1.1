1.1 Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Signals

1.1.1 Examples and Mathematical Representation

1.1.2 Signal Energy and Power
The total energy over the time interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 in a continuous-time signal x(t) is defined as 
                        ∫[t1,t2]{|x(t)|**2}dt.    (1.4)
The time-averaged power is obtained by dividing eq.(1.4) by the length t2 - t1.

The total energy in a discrete-time signal x[n] over the time interval n1 ≤ n ≤ n2 is defined as
                         ∑[n=n1,n2]{|x[n]|**2}.  (1.5)
And dividing by the number of points in the interval, n2 - n1 + 1 is the averaged power.

In many systems we will be interested in examming power and energy in signals over an infinite time interval, for -∞ < t < +∞ or for -∞ < n < +∞.

In continuous time:
     E[∞] ∆= lim[T->∞]∫[-T,T]{|x(t)|**2}dt = ∫[-∞,+∞]{|x(t)|**2}dt.  (1.6)
In discrete time:
     E[∞] ∆= lim[N->∞]∑[n=-N,+N]{|x[t]|**2} = ∑[n=-∞,+∞]{|x[n]|**2}.  (1.7)

Note that for some signals the integral in eq.(1.6) or sum in eq.(1.7) might not converge. If x(t) or x[n] equals a nonzero constant value for all time, such signals have infinite energy, while signals with E[∞] < ∞ have finite energy.

Define the time-averaged power over an infinite interval as
            P[∞] ∆= lim[T->∞]{1/(2T)∫[-T,T]{|x(t)|**2}dt}   (1.8)
            P[∞] ∆= lim[N->∞]{1/(2N+1)∑[n=-N,+N]{|x[n]|**2}}   (1.9)

Three important classes of signals.
1. The class of signals with finite total energy E[∞] < ∞, and P[∞] = 0.
2. The class of signals with finite average power P[∞], and E[∞] = ∞.
3. The class of signals with infinite energy and power E[∞] = ∞ and P[∞] = ∞.
