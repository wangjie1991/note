1.2 TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

A central concept in signal and system analysis is that of the transformation of a signal. In this section, we focus on a very limited but important class of elementary signal transformations that involve simple modification of the independent variable, the time axis.

1.2.1   Examples of Transformations of the Independent Variable
Time Shift

Time Reversal
The signal x[-n] is obtained from the signal x[n] by a reflection about n=0.
The signal x(-t) is obtained from the signal x(t) by a reflection about t=0.

Time Scaling
x(t), x(2t), and x(t/2) are related by linear scale changes in the independent variable.

If x(t) represents an audio tape recording, then x(-t) is the same tape recording played backward, x(2t) is that recording played at twice the speed, and x(t/2) is the recording played at half-speed.


1.2.2   Periodic Signals
A periodic continuous-time signal x(t) has the property that there is a positive value of T for which
                             x(t) = x(t + T) (1.11)
for all values of t. In other words, a periodic signal has the property that is unchanged by a time shift of T. We say that x(t) is periodic with period T.

If x(t) is periodic with period T, then x(t) = x(t + mT) for all t and for any integer m. The fundamental period T0 of x(t) is the smallest positive value of T. This definition of the fundamental period works, except if x(t) is a constant. In this case the fundamental period is undefined. A signal x(t) that is not periodic will be referred to as an aperiodic signal.

A discrete-time signal x[n] is periodic with period N, where N is a positive integer, if it is unchanged by a time shift of N, if
                             x[n] = x[n + N] (1.12)
for all values of n. The fundamental period N0 is the smallest positive value of N.

Example 1.4
The problem that whether or not a given signal is periodic.
x(t) =  cos(t)  if t<0
        sin(t)  if tâ‰¥0 


1.2.3   Even and Odd Signals
A signal x(t) or x[n] is referred to as an even signal if it is identical to its time-reversed counterpart, with its reflection about the origin.
A continuous-time signal is even if x(-t) = x(t)    (1.14)
A discrete-time signal is even if x[-n] = x[n]  (1.15)
A signal is referred to as odd if x(-t) = -x(t) (1.16)
                                  x[-n] = -x[n] (1.17)

An important fact is that any signal can be broken into a sum of two signals, one of which is even and one of which is odd.
Even part of x(t):  Ev{x(t)} = 1/2[x(t) + x(-t)]    (1.18)
Odd part of x(t):   Od{x(t)} = 1/2[x(t) - x(-t)]    (1.19)
