1.2 TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

A central concept in signal and system analysis is that of the transformation of a signal. In this section, we focus on a very limited but important class of elementary signal transformations that involve simple modification of the independent variable, the time axis.

1.2.1   Examples of Transformations of the Independent Variable
1. time shift.

2. time reversal.
The signal x[-n] is obtained from the signal x[n] by a reflection about n=0.
The signal x(-t) is obtained from the signal x(t) by a reflection about t=0.

3. time scaling.
x(t), x(2t), and x(t/2) are related by linear scale changes in the independent variable.

If x(t) represents an audio tape recording, then x(-t) is the same tape recording played backward, x(2t) is that recording played at twice the speed, and x(t/2) is the recording played at half-speed.
