2.1 DISCRETE-TIME LTI SYSTEMS: THE CONVOLUTION SUM

2.1.1 The representation of Discrete-Time Signals in Terms of Impulses
The key idea in visualizing how the discrete-time unit impulse can be used to construct any discrete-time signal is to think of a discrete-time signal as a sequence of individual impulses.

In generally, by including additional shifted, scaled impulses, we can get
         x[n] = ... + x[-1]δ[n+1] + x[0]δ[n] + x[1]δ[n-1] + ...  (2.1)
For any value of n, only one of the terms on the right-hand side of eq.(2.1) is nonzero, and the scaling associated with that term is precisely x[n].

In more compact form, we have
                      x[n] = ∑[k=-∞,+∞]{x[k]δ[n-k]}  (2.2)
This corresponds to the representation of an arbitrary sequence as a linear combination of shifted unit impulses δ[n-k], where the weights in this linear combination are x[k].
Equation(2.2) is called the |sifting property|(筛选性质) of the discrete-time unit impulse. Because the sequence δ[n-k] is nonzero only when k = n, the summation on the right-hand side of eq.(2.2) "sifts" through the sequence of values x[k] and preserves only the value corresponding to k = n.

As an example, consider x[n]=u[n], the unit step. In this case, eq.(2.2) becomes
                            u[n] = ∑[k=0,+∞]{δ[n-k]}


2.1.2 The Discrete-Time Unit Impulse Response and the Convolution-Sum 
      Representation of LTI Systems
The response of a linear system to x[n] will be the superposition(叠加) of the scaled responses of the system to each of these shifted impulses. The property of time invariance tells us that the responses of a time-invariant system to the time-shifted unit impulses are simply time-shifted versions of one another.

Consider the response of a linear system to an arbitrary input x[n]. Let h[k][n] denote the response of the linear system to the shifted unit impulse δ[n-k]. Then the response y[n] of the linear system to the input x[n] in eq.(2.2) is simply the weighted linear combination of these basic responses.
                     y[n] = ∑[k=-∞,+∞]{x[k]h[k][n]}  (2.3)

In general, the responses h[k][n] need not be related to each other for different value of k. However, if the linear system is also time invariant, then these responses to time-shifted unit impulses are all time-shifted versions of each other. Since δ[n-k] is a time-shifted version of δ[n], the response h[k][n] is a time-shifted version of h[0][n].
                           h[k][n] = h[0][n-k]  (2.4)
For notational convenience, we define the unit impulse response
                             h[n] = h[0][n]  (2.5)
Then for an LTI system
                      y[n] = ∑[k=-∞,+∞]{x[k]h[n-k]}  (2.6)
The eq.(2.6) is referred to as the convolution sum or superposition sum. The operation on the right-hand side of eq.(2.6) is known as the convolution of the sequences x[n] and h[n]. We will represent the operation of convolution as
                           y[n] = x[n] * h[n]  (2.7)
We see that an LTI system is completely characterized by its response to the unit response.


Example 2.4
Consider the two sequences
x[n] = { 1, 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 }     h[n] = { α**n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 6 }
       { 0, otherwise }            { 0, otherwise    }
Consider x[k]h[n-k], it's convenient to consider 5 separate intervals for n.

1. For n < 0, there is no overlap between the nonzero positions of x[k] and 
   h[n-k], and consequently, y[n] = 0.

2. For 0 ≤ n ≤ 4,
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), 0 ≤ k ≤ n
                { 0,        otherwise
   Thus, in this interval,
   y[n] = ∑[k=0,n]{α**(n-k)}  (2.14)
   Specifically, changing the variable of summation in eq.(2.14) from k to
   r = n - k, we have
   y[n] = ∑[r=0,n]{α**r} = (1 - α**(n+1)) / (1 - α)

3. For 4 < n ≤ 6, 
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), 0 ≤ k ≤ 4
                { 0,        otherwise
   Thus, in this interval,
   y[n] = ∑[k=0,4]{α**(n-k)}  (2.15)
   y[n] = (α**n)∑[k=0,4]{(α**-1)**k} = (α**n)((1 - α(-1)**5)/(1 - α**(-1)))
        = (α**(n-4) - α**(n+1))/(1-α)  (2.16)

4. For 6 < n but n-6 ≤ 4 (6 < n ≤ 10)
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), n-6 ≤ k ≤ 4
                { 0,        otherwise
   so that,
   y[n] = ∑[k=n-6,4]{α**(n-k)}
   Letting r = k - n + 6, we obtain
   y[n] = ∑[r=0,10-n]{α**(6-r)} = (α**6)∑[r=0,10-n]{(α**(-1))**r}
        = (α**(n-4) - α**7) / (1 - α)

5. For n - 6 > 4, there is no overlap between the nonzero portions of x[k]
   and h[n-k], and hence y[n] = 0.

Example 2.5
Consider an LTI system with input x[n] and unit impulse response h[n] specified as follows:
x[n] = (2**n)u[-n]  (2.17)
h[n] = u[n]  (2.18)
