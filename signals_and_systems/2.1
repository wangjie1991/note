2.1 DISCRETE-TIME LTI SYSTEMS: THE CONVOLUTION SUM

2.1.1 The representation of Discrete-Time Signals in Terms of Impulses


Example 2.4
Consider the two sequences
x[n] = { 1, 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 }     h[n] = { α**n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 6 }
       { 0, otherwise }            { 0, otherwise    }
Consider x[k]h[n-k], it's convenient to consider 5 separate intervals for n.

1. For n < 0, there is no overlap between the nonzero positions of x[k] and 
   h[n-k], and consequently, y[n] = 0.

2. For 0 ≤ n ≤ 4,
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), 0 ≤ k ≤ n
                { 0,        otherwise
   Thus, in this interval,
   y[n] = ∑[k=0,n]{α**(n-k)}  (2.14)
   Specifically, changing the variable of summation in eq.(2.14) from k to
   r = n - k, we have
   y[n] = ∑[r=0,n]{α**r} = (1 - α**(n+1)) / (1 - α)

3. For 4 < n ≤ 6, 
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), 0 ≤ k ≤ 4
                { 0,        otherwise
   Thus, in this interval,
   y[n] = ∑[k=0,4]{α**(n-k)}  (2.15)
   y[n] = (α**n)∑[k=0,4]{(α**-1)**k} = (α**n)((1 - α(-1)**5)/(1 - α**(-1)))
        = (α**(n-4) - α**(n+1))/(1-α)  (2.16)

4. For 6 < n but n-6 ≤ 4 (6 < n ≤ 10)
   x[k]h[n-k] = { α**(n-k), n-6 ≤ k ≤ 4
                { 0,        otherwise
   so that,
   y[n] = ∑[k=n-6,4]{α**(n-k)}
   Letting r = k - n + 6, we obtain
   y[n] = ∑[r=0,10-n]{α**(6-r)} = (α**6)∑[r=0,10-n]{(α**(-1))**r}
        = (α**(n-4) - α**7) / (1 - α)

5. For n - 6 > 4, there is no overlap between the nonzero portions of x[k]
   and h[n-k], and hence y[n] = 0.

Example 2.5
Consider an LTI system with input x[n] and unit impulse response h[n] specified as follows:
x[n] = (2**n)u[-n]  (2.17)
h[n] = u[n]  (2.18)


2.2 CONTINUOUS-TIME LTI SYSTEMS: THE CONVOLUTION INTEGRAL

2.2.1 The Representation of Continuous-Time Signals in Terms of Impulses

To develop the continuous-time counterpart of the discrete-time sifting property in eq.(2.2), we begin by considering a pulse or 'staircase' approximation, x^(t), to a continuous-time signal x(t). This approximation can be expressed as a linear combination of delayed pulses,
